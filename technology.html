                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">In software engineering course the final project was building an android university application. In this project, I was given the role of team leader of a team of 6. To complete this project, we need to complete two tasks. Having a working application and writing documentation for it.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">I was the leader of this project and I learned a lot from it. It improved my leadership skills, teamwork skills, as well as technical skills. In this project, I learned how to develop a mobile app using Android Studio. Furthermore, I improved my Java coding skills and learned Php. Also, I learned how to connect an application with a database using MySQL database. More than that, I expanded my knowledge by using Git and GitHub as the main remote repository of the project. Lastly, I learned how to design a mobile app using XML markup language.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Connected Component Algorithm</h2>
                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">In Computer vision the instructor gave us the assignment to implement the connected component algorithm. More specifically we have to implement using iterative as well as recursive approach. He gave as the choice to pick any programming language and I chose Python.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">Python's simple syntax allowed me to focus more on the logic behind my implementation. Furthermore, I learned from this assignment how to use numpy which is a math library. Furthermore, I learned how to use OpenCV to show and manipulate images. Also, while debugging the code I learned how to improve my code by using simpler approaches to solve a problem. This made my code easier to understand and easier to maintain.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Algorithms Analysis</h2>
                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">Algorithms Analysis was required in the Algorithms class in junior year. The instructor asked us to implement algorithms with different time complexity and see how the algorithms behave as the size of the input increase. Starting with a content time algorithm and ending with an exponential time algorithm. Also, he gave us the choice to choose any programming language.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">The outcome of this assignment is to have a feeling how algorithms behave when the input increases. To do that I implemented algorithms with constant, linear, logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential time. I learn from this assignment how to implement several algorithms using Python programming language. The most important ones are binary search and merge sort. Also, I learn how to write a parallel program to utilize all the hardware resources. Most importantly this assignment made me think more before coding any solution to see if it's sufficient or not.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Customer Service</h2>
                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">Customer Service assignment was required in sophomore year in the data structure class. In this assignment, the instructor asked us to write a program for a bank that should reports when the customers came and for how long did, they stay. giving that every four minutes a customer inters and it takes seven minutes to serve one customer.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">The outcomes of this assignment were that I learned how to implement the stack data structure. I learned from this assignment how to implement it using a linked-list that offers dynamic memory allocation. Also, I learned how to use the existing date and time java classes to store and manipulate time objects. Additionally, I learn how to use streams to make my code runs faster. Finally, I learned how to use GitHub to store and control the development prosses through the git version control system.</p>
