                    <p class="text-faded">For this assignment, the instructor explained the issue briefly and told as to read the case and use the critical thinking circle to come up with a solution. This was a group assignment and we were a group of four students.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">By doing this task I learn to do my research first before I jump to a solution. After each student did his research and studied the critical thinking circle. We arranged a meeting at the university library and we discuss our finding to come up with the final solution. This meeting helps me to improve my critical thinking by learning how other students think critically. </p>

                    <p class="text-faded">In the critical thinking course during my freshman year, we were required to think about if organs should be sold on the open market. This was the grope assignment and each team consist of four students. We have to study the case and write 200 words paragraph about it. </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">To meet the requirements my team members and I met several times in the library to share our ideas and talk about the question that we have to answer. I learned from this assignment how to search, and think critically. Also, I improved my communication skills while I was talking with the team about the assignment. I recommend every student to take this assignment seriously to improve their critical thinking skills.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Prime Numbers Linked List Project</h2>
                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">In the computer science II course during my freshman year, we were required to implement a linked list that holed only prime numbers. We have to implement four functions. First, A function that takes two arguments the first one is the lowest possible value in the linked list the second argument is the numbers on prime numbers that you want to generate. Second, A function that removes the duplicated values in the linked list. Third, A function that merges four different linked lists. Last, A function that revers the linked list. </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">In this assignment, I learn how to come up with a solution that meets the requirement and improves my solution gradually. I started with the simplest way to generate a prime number using a recursive method which chick if any number smaller a given number is divisible by it or not. If none of the numbers is divisible then It's a prime number. The problem with this approach that I have to check with a lot of numbers that are not divisible which made my program slow and only can generate the first 6000 prime number. To make it faster after 2 I only chick the odd numbers if they are prime or not. Also, I chick with the numbers that are smaller than half of the input this made my program faster and raised the limit to the first 20000 prime numbers. To make it even faster I changed my approach checking only the odd number after two and only trying to divide by odd number which raised the limit to the first 31000 prime numbers. For the second requirement, I implemented the Bubble sort algorithm due to the limitation of the linked list data structure which is having to go throw linear time element access. The last two requirements wore easy to implement. This project taught me how to think critically to find a solution and improve my solution.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Algorithms assignment 2</h2>
                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">In the Algorithms course during my junior year, we were given a problem set that contains seven questions. We had to solve this problem and try to improve the solution gradually. Also, we have to analyze the solution in terms of space and time complexity. For this assignment, the doctor gave us the choice of the programming language that we have to use.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">This assignment was challenging to solve and learned a lot from it I'll high light some of the things a learn. One of the questions was Find in constant space where the circular is starting in a circular linked list such that, the last pointer could point to any node in the list. To solve this problem, I created to pointers to the head node then I moved them with a different speed such that, the first pointer moves one step forward and the other move two steps. when the pointer meets, I reset one of them to the head of the linked list. Finally, I move them again but this time at the same speed just one step at a time they will meet at the starting point of the circular linked list.</p>
