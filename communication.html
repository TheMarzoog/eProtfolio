                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">Our writing communication instructor asked as to write an argument essay of 380-400 words. He gave us six topics to choose from. I wrote about Why College Students Shouldnâ€™t be Punished for Absence because I am with it.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">This assignment helped me to improve several communication skills. First, how can I express my point of view regarding a particular issue? By opening the topic from a wider perspective and then narrowing it down to what I stand for. Second, Improve my arguments by studies and statistics. Finally, giving examples to support my statements.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Informative Presentation</h2>
                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">In this assignment a was asked to make an informative presentation about any topic of my choice. Since it was informative, I chose I topic that I am familiar with. Photography equipment more specifically cameras and lenses. Each student was given five minutes to print. </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">The Issue that I faced in this assignment is time. I found five minutes too short to inform the audience. Since I had 9 years of experience in photography, I thought that it was essential to talk about cameras and lenses in detail. Fortunately, I had an amazing instructor who helps me to narrow down the topic. So, in the end, I decided to talk just about the basic technical aspic of them. Thus, I just explain the difference between each type of camera and what are they use for. and I did the same thing for lenses. I learned from doing this presentation how to simplify advance ideas and teach them to an audience. Also, how to get their attention by change my voice note and using body language. Lastly, this presentation made me more confident in a public speech.</p>

                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">This project was assigned to us in the Computer Organization course during my sophomore year. The instructor asked us to choose a topic from a list that he provided. For this project, we have to write a research paper diving into the hardware detail of the topic we chose. Also, we have to make a presentation explaining our topic. </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">For this project, I chose quantum computing as my topic. I learned how to simplify complex quantum mechanics phenomena and make them understandable. Also, I learned how to search for a resource. Those resources helped me to improve my writing and reading skills. To prepare the presentation I used IBM's quantum computer to show the class how the quantum computer is used today after explaining the basic idea behind it. I learned from this presentation the importance of visual representation to simplify complex ideas. Also, the effect on hand-on experience into making the topic clearer.</p>

I started the presentation by giving a brief introduction to Linus and what he did for the technology industry. Then, I talk about Linux and how it is used by everyone in everyday life. Linux is the most used operating system in the severs that derive the internal. Also, it is used in other devices such as android phones, TVs, smart home devices, and many more. For the version control system git is used in developing most software these days. I learned from this presentation how to express my respect for a technical person to nun-technical listeners.</p>
