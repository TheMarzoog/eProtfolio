                    <p class="text-faded">In software engineering course the final project was building an android university application. In this project, I was given the role of team leader of a team of 6. To complete this project, we need to complete two tasks. Having a working application and writing documentation for it.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">This assignment taught me how to divide the tasks for the team. I did it by dividing the team into two teams. Development team, which was led by me. This team was in charge of developing the software and testing it. Documentation team, which was led by a fellow student. Each team consists of 3 members. Every day I talk to the other leader to see the progress and report our advancement in the project. This assignment taught me how to use GitHub and agile practices to achieve my final goal. </p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">This assignment taught me to step up and lead the team. In the beginning, the work was not organized and each member was working on his own. So, I decided to manage the work by doing two things. I created a Trello board with the tasks written on it. Then I told each member to pick a task. The second thing is a shared google document to write our notes. I learn from this assignment, how to manage and interact with a team remotely and effectively.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">I am the president of TechnoHub club which focuses on CCES students. One of our main goals is to provide support for the student to help them improve their technical skills. We did several activities such as how to build a PC and CS I and CS II Helpdesk. The Helpdesk toke a one-week durations amid to help the students to prepare for the final exams. </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">This was the first event that I managed since I became the president of the club. Five students were involved in the preparation process one designed the poster. The vice president and I work with the works on timing and finding a place for the event. The other prepared some code examples so we can use them when we explain to other students. Managing this event taught me a lot of skills needed to lead a team most importantly how to communicate with the other team members. </p>
