In this project, I was given the role of team leader of a team of 6. To complete this project, we need to complete two tasks. Having a working application and writing documentation for it.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">I was the leader of this project and I divided the team into two. Documentation team and development team. I was mostly working with the development team. I learned from working with a team on how to use GitHub to share my work. Furthermore, I learn extreme programming which is; coding on parse and releasing a new version of the software as fast as possible to see the mistake early in the development prosses. From interacting with others, I learned how to use Android Studio effectively and How to use databases. Also, I learned how to collaborate with other in technology project to get a better result.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">This assignment thought me how to work on a team to implant an algorithm. Furthermore, I tough me how to solve practical issues and discuss them with a team. Also, it improved my teaching skills and made me think of ways to simplify complex ideas.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">In the Database course during my sophomore year, we were required to make a project. The project should be a desktop application that uses a database to store information. The application should be developed using Visual Basic programming language and MySQL for database management. For this project, the instructor gave us the choice to do it solo or as a team.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">For this project, I chose to work with a team to improve my teamwork skills. We develop a music sales app using visual studio as an IDE.  The application took two weeks to be developed. During this time, we used to meat in the university in our break time to work on it. I learned from this project how to celebrate with the developer to reach the final product. Also, working with a team enhanced my communication and technical skills.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">To meet the requirements each team member picked a specific point of the research. One did the weddings in the past, another one did marriage at a young age, and I did Consanguinity marriage.  To write the paper we google docs and each member wrote his part. In the end, we met and wrote the introduction and the conclusion. For the presentation, we used Prezi to make the slides and similar to the writing part each member worked on his part.
